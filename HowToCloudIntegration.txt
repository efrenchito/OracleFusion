@Using External Data Integration Services for Oracle ERP Cloud (2102800.1)
 + Inbound Data Management:
  Use External Data Integration Services for Oracle Cloud to load data into Oracle Fusion Applications from external sources.   
    High-volume data import scenarios
    Support of legacy data migration, as well as recurring bulk data import 
    Automation of end-to-end import flows with web service architecture
    Tracking of import processes for completion, errors, and resubmission
    Notifications in the form of e-mail and callback to automate data validation and error resolution 
    Predefined import templates for business objects
   
   Overview
    There are several scenarios where data from on-premise or external business systems needs to be imported into Oracle
    ERP Cloud to consummate business transactions.
    
    External Data Integration Services for Oracle Cloud include the following components:
    • Templates to structure, format, and generate the data file according to the requirements of the target application tables.
    • File-based load process to load the data files into the interface tables.
    • Application-specific data import processes to transfer data from interface tables to the application tables in your 
      Oracle Fusion Applications.

    -> see Figure2: Inbound data integration orchestration flow (Page 10)
    
   
 + Outbound Data Management
    Standard prebuilt reports across applications that can be run on demand
    BI Publisher report capabilities that empower users with custom reporting tools
    Efficient data extract formats such as XML, CSV, and TXT
    Automation of end-to-end export flows with web service architecture
    Tracking of export processes for completion, error tracking, and resubmission
    Features which empower businesses with notification such as e-mail and callback to initiate downstream business
     tasks or operations
     
   Overview
    Exporting data from Oracle ERP Cloud typically consists of the following steps:
     1. Create a BI Publisher report(s) using the respective Enterprise Scheduler (ESS) job or BI Publisher Dashboard.
     2. Invoke the Oracle ERP Integration Service to initiate the respective export job.
     3. Provide notification through asynchronous callback upon completion.
     4. Deliver the status and information using callback to access extracted data file(s) from the Oracle ERP Cloud.
     5. Review any errors if applicable and take appropriate action, such as process the data extracted for further
        downstream business operation needs

     -> see Figure3: Outbound data integration orchestration flow
     
 + What's New in Oracle ERP Cloud Release 12?
   1. New operations importBulkData and exportBulkData that further simplify bulk data management.
   2. Encryption option to secure data files for import and export processes.
   3. Capability of efficiently handling large files.
   4. Purging of product application interface tables where needed.
   5. Multi-threading bulk import process.
   
   
   Automated End-to-End Inbound (Bulk Import) Orchestrated Flow
    Prerequisites
      Import a certificate into your local keystore.
      Configure the sample web service tester.
      Identify the user name and password to call the Import Journals process.
      Verify that the user has access to the AttachmentsRead role in the UCM server.
      Verify the end point URL for the web service.
     
    Flow Steps
     1. Generate the data file for the object you want to import.
     2. Prepare the request payload for the ImportBulkData operation of the Oracle ERP Integration Service.
       a. Uploads the data file to the UCM server.
       b. Loads data from the file on the UCM server to the respective product interface table(s).
       c. Imports the data from the product interface table(s) to the respective Oracle ERP product main table(s).
       d. Extracts errors and logs into a ZIP file and uploads them to the respective UCM account.
       e. Purges the interface and errors tables related to the respective import job.
       f. Notifies users upon completion of all ESS jobs using bell, e-mail, or callback URL as defined in the payload.
     3. Receive a bell, e-mail, or callback notification for the request identifier returned by the web service
     4. Prepare the payload for the getDocumentForDocumentId operation to download the output file.
